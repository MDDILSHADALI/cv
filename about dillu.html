    <p>We’ve all heard the cliché that writers have big egos — so it makes sense that there’s a section in every book<br> where you’re required to talk about the author (meaning yourself).

        That said, it’s crucial to get the About the Author right. Whether it appears on the back of your book,<br> your Amazon Author page, your social media or all of the above,<br> you should make every sentence count (and tailor it depending on where it will appear).<br> For non-fiction authors, who you are can be more important than what you write about.<br> For indie fiction writers, this is an opportunity to let your growing readership get to know you.
        
        If you're here to learn the ropes, we’ve already published<br> an extensive guide on how to write an author bio. <br>In this post, we'll be looking at 13 About the Author examples to further illustrate what works (and what doesn't).
